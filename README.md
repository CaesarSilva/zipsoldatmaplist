# zipsoldatmaplist

It depends on maps.js, from urraka/pms-info and adm-zip.  
https://github.com/urraka/pms-info  
npm install adm-zip  
Put it in the parent folder of the "maps" folder and run it using nodejs.  
node processmaplist.js  
It will parse the file mapslist.txt and zip the files within a certain range. (from currentmapnum to maplimit).
